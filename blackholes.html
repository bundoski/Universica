        <h2 class="text-white-50 text-center mt-4">An Introduction To Black Holes</h2>
        <hr class="text-black-50">
        <p class="text-white text-center mb-4" style="font-size:19px;">Black holes are objects in the universe with so
            much mass trapped inside their boundaries
            that they have incredibly
            strong gravitational fields. In fact, the gravitational force of a black hole is so strong that nothing can
            escape
            once it has gone inside. Not even light can escape a black hole, it is trapped inside along with stars, gas,
            and
            dust. Most black holes contain many times the mass of our Sun and the heaviest ones can have millions of
            solar masses.
            Despite all that mass, the actual singularity that forms the core of the black hole has never been seen or
            imaged. It is, as the word suggests, a tiny point in space, but it has a LOT of mass. Astronomers are only
            able to study these objects through their effect on the material that surrounds them.
            The material around the black hole forms a rotating disk that lies just beyond a
            region called "the event horizon," which is the gravitational point of no return.</p>
        <h3 class="text-white-50">The Structure of a Black Hole</h3>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">The basic "building block" of the black hole is the singularity: a
            pinpoint region of space that contains all the mass of the black hole. Around it is a region of space from
            which light cannot escape, giving the "black hole" its name. The outer "edge" of this region is what forms
            the event horizon. It's the invisible boundary where the pull of the gravitational field is equal to the
            speed of light. It's also where gravity and light speed are balanced.

            The event horizon's position depends on the gravitational pull of the black hole. Astronomers calculate the
            location of an
            event horizon around a black hole using the equation Rs = 2GM/c2. R is the radius of the singularity, G is
            the force of
            gravity, M is the mass, c is the speed of light. </p>

        <h3 class="text-white-50">Black Hole Types and How They Form</h3>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">
            There are different types of black holes, and they come about in different ways. The most common type is
            known as a stellar-mass black hole.
            These contain roughly up to a few times the mass of our Sun, and form when large main sequence stars (10 -
            15 times the mass of our Sun) run out of nuclear fuel in their cores. The result is a massive supernova
            explosion that blasts the stars outer layers to space. What's left behind collapses to create a black hole.
            The two other types of black holes are supermassive black holes (SMBH) and micro black holes. A single SMBH
            can contain the mass of millions or
            billions of suns. Micro black holes are, as their name implies, very tiny. They might have perhaps only 20
            micrograms of mass. In both cases, the
            mechanisms for their creation are not entirely clear. Micro black holes exist in theory but have not been
            directly detected.

            Supermassive black holes are found to exist in the cores of most galaxies and their origins are still hotly
            debated. It's possible that supermassive black
            holes are the result of a merger between smaller, stellar-mass black holes and other matter. Some
            astronomers suggest that they might be created when a single highly massive
            (hundreds of times the mass of the Sun) star collapses. Either way, they are massive enough to affect the
            galaxy in many ways, ranging from effects on
            starbirth rates to the orbits of stars and material in their near vicinity.

        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">
            Micro black holes, on the other hand, could be created during the collision of two very high-energy
            particles. Scientists suggest this happens continuously in the upper atmosphere of Earth and is likely to
            happen during particle physics experiments at such places as CERN. </p>

        <h3 class="text-white-50">How Scientists Measure Black Holes</h3>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">Since light can not escape from the region around a black hole
            affected by the event horizon, nobody can really "see" a black hole. However, astronomers can measure and
            characterize them by the effects they have on their surroundings. Black holes that are near other objects
            exert a gravitational effect on them. For one thing, mass can also be determined by the orbit of material
            around the black hole.</p>

            <div class="col text-center">
                <img src="pulsatingblackhole.jpg" width="500px;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">
            In practice, astronomers deduce the presence of the black hole by studying how light behaves around it.
            Black holes, like all massive objects, have enough gravitational pull to bend light's path as it passes by.
            As stars behind the black hole move relative to it, the light emitted by them will appear distorted, or the
            stars will appear to move in an unusual way. From this information, the position and mass of the black hole
            can be determined.

            This is especially apparent in galaxy clusters where the combined mass of the clusters, their dark matter,
            and their black holes create oddly-shaped arcs and rings by bending the light of more distant objects as it
            passes by.

            Astronomers can also see black holes by the radiation the heated material around them gives off, such as
            radio or x rays. The speed of that material also gives important clues to the characteristics of the black
            hole it's trying to escape.</p>


        <h3 class="text-white-50">Hawking Radiation</h3>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">The final way that astronomers could possibly detect a black hole
            is through a mechanism known as Hawking radiation. Named for the famed theoretical physicist and cosmologist
            Stephen Hawking, Hawking radiation is a consequence of thermodynamics that requires that energy escape from
            a black hole.

            The basic idea is that, due to natural interactions and fluctuations in the vacuum, the matter will be
            created in the form of an electron and anti-electron (called a positron). When this occurs near the event
            horizon, one particle will be ejected away from the black hole, while the other will fall into the
            gravitational well.

            To an observer, all that is "seen" is a particle being emitted from the black hole. The particle would be
            seen as having positive energy. This means, by symmetry, that the particle that fell into the black hole
            would have negative energy. The result is that as a black hole ages, it loses energy, and therefore loses
            mass (by Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2, where E=energy, M=mass, and C is the speed of light).</p>
